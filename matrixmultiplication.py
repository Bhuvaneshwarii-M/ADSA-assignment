"""

Explanation:

The matrix_chain_multiplication function initializes a cost matrix (cost) and a parenthetical matrix (parenthetical) for dynamic programming.
The dynamic programming algorithm fills in the cost matrix by considering all possible split points in the matrix chain.
The recurrence relation involves finding the optimal split point (k) that minimizes the total cost of multiplication.
The construct_parenthesization function is used to reconstruct the optimal parenthesization by recursively building the expression based on the split points.

Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(n^3) where n is the number of matrices. This is because there are three nested loops used to fill the cost matrix.
Space Complexity: O(n^2) for storing the cost and parenthetical matrices.
Efficiency for Large Instances:

The dynamic programming approach is efficient for large instances of the matrix chain multiplication problem, thanks to its polynomial time complexity.
